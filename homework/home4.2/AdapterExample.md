Example of Adapter Pattern Usage:

Context: Imagine you have an old library that provides functionality for working with TXT files. However, your new system needs to work with files in JSON format.

Solution Using Adapter Pattern:

1. Create an adapter that translates operations called for working with TXT files into operations for working with JSON.
2. This adapter will provide an interface expected by your new system, but internally it will utilize functions and capabilities of the old TXT file library.
3. Implement a new class, for instance JSONFileAdapter, which implements an interface suitable for working with JSON.
4. This class will use objects and methods from the old TXT file library to provide the required functionality for JSON.
5. Your system can now use JSONFileAdapter to work with JSON files, leveraging the existing TXT file functionality through the adapter.

Thus, the adapter pattern facilitates the integration of existing functionality or libraries with a new system that expects a different interface or data format.
